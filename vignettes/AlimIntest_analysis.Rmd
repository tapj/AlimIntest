Abstract
-----------

Gut microbiota richness and stability seems to be an important parameter in host-microbe symbiosis.
 Diet might be one way to maintain or restore high richness in the gut microbiota notably using dietary fibers.
 However, the impact of diet on the stability and richness of human gut microbiota is not fully characterized.
 In this work, through a six week nutritional trial, 19 healthy adults consumed a basal diet supplemented
 with 10 or 40 g dietary fiber per day for five days, followed by 15-day washout periods. Fecal samples were
 collected at four time points and were analyzed by a combination of 16S rRNA gene targeted pyrosequencing,
 intestinal cell genotoxicity and short chain fatty analysis. Metatranscriptomic sequencing approach was also
 done for a subgroup of subjects. Whatever the taxonomic levels studied, changing dietary fiber amount did not
 have the same impact for all individuals but remained significant within each individual gut microbiota at genus,
 family and phylum levels. Higher gut microbiota richness is associated with higher gut microbiota stability to
 marked changes in dietary fiber intake which is also accompanied by the modulation of the expression of numerous
 gut microbiota metabolic pathways like glycan and methanogenesis metabolism. Higher microbial richness is also associated
 with higher proportions of _Prevotella_, _Coprococcus_ and _Dorea_ species and higher levels of caproate and valerate.
 Microbiota richness was not associated with intestinal cell genotoxicity and this was not modulated by diet.
 This study provides new insights on the impact of gut microbiota on dietary modulation of host-microbe symbiosis.

Study design
------------
The aim of this study was to revaluate the diet change using different fibers intake on human health, 
using an integrated approach to characterize gut microbiome composition and activity. 
We undertook a randomized nutritional intervention in 19 healthy adults, 
with controlled normal diets providing 10 then 40g or 40 then 10g natural fibers per day. 
Four time points were collected per individual and random duplicates were added to the dataset. 
The microbiota composition was assessed by quantitative PCR and 454 pyrosequencing. 
The microbial activity was measured by metatranscriptomics. 
The bacterial fermentation was evaluated by short chain fatty acid analysis. 
In addition, the impact of the diet on host DNA damage was analysed using the standard assay, the Comet assay on HT29 cell line.

**Fig. S1: Cross over nutritional intervention of this study.** Each disc represents a collection point.
 The blue group was composed of nine individuals, who first had 40g fiber/day;
 the orange group of 10 individuals who started with 10g fiber/day.
 During the 15-day washout period, the individuals were on their usual personal diet without any constraint.

### Whole 454 reads dataset processing

Sequences reads data were processed with _Lotus_ with at least 200 nucleotides
 as quality filter to build OTU and 100 pb to remap reads against OTU representatives sequences.
 More information about _Lotus_ documentation could be found here : http://psbweb05.psb.ugent.be/lotus/documentation.html

A between class analysis is done to quantify individual and diet effect on global variation. Microbiota summaries were done after normalisation at phylum, class, order, family, genus and OTU levels using 454 pyrosequencing sequencing. Inertia attributed to diet and host was then challenged against Monte Carlo simulated dataset.

**Fig. 1: Gut microbiota inertia variations according to diet and subjects at different taxonomic levels.** Between class analysis was used to measure the inertia using diet and individual alternatively as instrumental variable. Monte Carlo (MC) simulated inertia (n=1000 simulation) was used to assess the significance of inertia attributed to different factors. When observed inertia is higher to the 95th percentile of MC simulated inertia then it is considered as significant.

___________________

When the observed inertia is above the 95th percentile of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated inertia, the effect was considered as significant.


Richness and comet vs Microbial changes
-----------------------------------------

We tested if microbial changes over-time is associated with microbial richness and genotoxicity (comet assays). We stratified observations into groups corresponding to samples taking after 10g fiber diet, 40g fiber diet and usual diet (corresponding to the washout period). Microbial changes was evaluated using the JSD distance metrics.

There was a significant link between microbial change and the estimated microbial richness before. In others words, microbial richness was predictive of microbial change over time. There is no significant association between comet assays and microbial richness. Microbial richness seems independent of the microbial change during the 10g fiber/day diet.

**Fig. 2: Gut microbiota change over time associated with OTU richness.**
 Microbial change within subject was assessed using the JSD distance metrics after 10g fiber per day, 
 40g fiber per day and the usual diet washout period. 
 Microbial richness account for the number of OTUs rarefied at the same levels 
 of sequences for each sample before the diet. 
 The two diet runs, 10 to 40g and 40 to 10g, were pictured by red and blue dots respectively. 
 Spearman correlation showed significant association

**Fig. 3: Association between microbial OTU richness, SCFA and bacterial genera.** 
The first principal component (PC1) from the co-inertia analysis between SCFA and 
microbial genera was associated significantly with microbial richness. 
Circle size account for OTU richness and color gradient account for 
caproate and valerate amount (left panel) and _Prevotella_/_Bacteroides_ ratio (right panel)

Conclusions
-----------------

This study provided the following information: 

- The response to the diet change was fast but specific to individual.

- This specific response is dependent of gut species richness. Low species richness microbiota showed more impact when diet change notably with high amount of fiber while high rich microbiota showed more stability _whatever the diet_.

- High rich microbiota have a high amount of caproate and valerate associated with _Prevotella_, _Coprococcus_ and _Dorea_ genera.

- Transcriptomics showed an increase in methanogenesis and glycan metabolism at 40g/fiber. 

- The genotoxicity on HT29 cells did not correlate with diet, gut gene richness and SCFA profile. 

We conclude that gut bacterial richness have to be taken in account for future nutritional intervention.
